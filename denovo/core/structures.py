structures: lightweight composite data structures adapted to denovo

denovo structures are primarily designed to be the backbones of workflows. So,
the provided subclasses assume that all edges in a composite structure are
unweighted and directed.

Classes:
    Node (Named, Proxy, collections.abc.Node): Wrapper for non-hashable 
        objections that a user wishes to store as nodes. It can be subclassed,
        but a subclass must be a dataclass and call super().__post_init__ to 
        ensure that the hash equivalence methods are added to subclasses.
    Graph (Bunch): a lightweight directed acyclic graph (DAG) that serves as
        the base class for denovo composite structures. Internally, the graph is
        stored as an adjacency list. As a result, it should primarily be used
        for workflows or other uses that do form large graphs. In those
        instances, an adjacency matrix would be far more efficient.
    System (Graph): a lightweight directed acyclic graph (DAG). Internally, the 
        graph is stored as an adjacency list. As a result, it should primarily 
        be used for workflows or other uses that do require large graphs.

To Do:
    Add an Edge class and seamless support for it in Graph to allow for weights,
        direction, and other edge attributes.
    Complete Network which will use an adjacency matrix for internal storage.
